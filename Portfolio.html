            <b>These images provide a structured overview of web development fundamentals. The first image is an
                introductory page for a web development course tailored for Kenza, featuring three main sections:
                “How
                does the web work?”, “What do you need to be a web developer?”, and “Why did I choose to learn web
                development?”. Each section is visually represented with colorful illustrations and a corresponding
                “Enter” button to dive deeper into the topics.
            </b> <br>
            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/38/82/93/38829333e7c09c3fda4d36eac26a9121.jpg" alt="image" width="350px"

            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1f/89/8f/1f898f97ea1fc51b31f8d4ccc5d11833.jpg" alt="image" width="350px"

            <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/75/c0/69/75c069990a1fcdf9b699062bbabbea40.jpg" alt="image" width="350px"
                height="200px" />
            <p>The second image elaborates on the “What do you need to be a web developer?” section, particularly
                focusing on “Hard coding”. It distinguishes between front-end and back-end development. The
                front-end
                section highlights the importance of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the necessity of using
                code
                editors and IDEs like VSC (Visual Studio Code). The back-end section underscores the need for
                programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, and C#, and emphasizes the importance of tools like
                Git,
                CMS platforms, and hosting servers. Additionally, the image outlines essential skills for web
                developers, including debugging, flexibility, and versatility to handle various web development
                tasks,
                from building websites from scratch to updating existing ones.</p>
